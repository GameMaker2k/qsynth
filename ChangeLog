ChangeLog

- Messages window fallback fix.


0.0.3   2003-12-12  Few tiny changes so far.

- Single shot timer and restart code path had a graceful rewrite.

- Messages window blankness rendering fix.

- Configure time detection of 'round' library function availability.

  internal MIDI player function is still broken.


0.0.2   2003-11-26  Minor bugfixes.

- New configure time argument debugging support (--enable-debug).
