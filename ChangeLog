ChangeLog

0.0.2   2003-11-26  Minor bugfixes.

- Gain, Reverb and Chorus front-panel settings are now loosely scaled
  and properly clipped; this is a first attempt to avoid unstable sound
  feedback behaviour namely on Reverb.

- MIDI input status led stickyness have been fixed.

- Soundfont open dialog now uses uppercase filter too (*.SF2).

- New configure time argument debugging support (--enable-debug).


0.0.1   2003-11-15  Primordial release.
