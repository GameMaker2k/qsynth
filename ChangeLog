qsynth - A fluidsynth Qt GUI Interface
--------------------------------------

ChangeLog

0.1.3   2004-02-29  More work in progress.

- Message window line limit is now a configurable option on setup.

- ALSA sequencer client name may now be internally set; not of great use
  for now, but it opens the ground for future workings.

- JACK multiple output port mode may now be configured on setup.

- Makefile.cvs makes its late entrance on the build toolset.


0.1.2   2004-02-16  Work in progress.

- Messages and Channels pop-up windows are not hinted as dialogs anymore
  and thus are not centered relative to parent main window which has become
  a strict Qt dialog widget behaviour (as of Qt 3.3+).

- Soundfont setup dialog changed to open and load multiple files at once.

- New setup option on wether all child windows are kept on top of the main
  window, or otherwise floating with probable taskbar entries of their own.

- Setup changes that are only effective next time the program is run gets
  an informational message box shown to the user.


0.1.1   2004-01-22  Yet more minor bugfixes.

- Messages color retouching.

- Popup menus memory leak fixed.


0.1.0   2003-12-29  Channel preset breakout.

- Added channels breakout and program preset view and edit windows,
  including a simple preset/profile management feature where the complete
  channel program assignments may be referenced and saved by name.

- Drag and dropped soundfont files are now accepted for immediate load.

- Messages window fallback fix.

- Standard output/error stream capture setup option; handler retouched
  to be line buffer oriented.


0.0.3   2003-12-12  Few tiny changes so far.

- Single shot timer and restart code path had a graceful rewrite.

- Messages window blankness rendering fix.

- Configure time detection of 'round' library function availability.

- Player drag and drop feature has been prepared, but somehow the
  internal MIDI player function is still broken.


0.0.2   2003-11-26  Minor bugfixes.

- Gain, Reverb and Chorus front-panel settings are now loosely scaled
  and properly clipped; this is a first attempt to avoid unstable sound
  feedback behaviour namely on Reverb.

- MIDI input status led stickyness have been fixed.

- Soundfont open dialog now uses uppercase filter too (*.SF2).

- New configure time argument debugging support (--enable-debug).


0.0.1   2003-11-15  Primordial release.
