Compiling qsynth-0.2.3 on Mac OS 10.4 (Tiger)
---------------------------------------------
by: Ebrahim Mayat <emayat at users dot sourceforge dot net>

1. Check that Apple's Xcode and X11SDK.pkg from the Tiger (10.4) CD are installed. (Xcode can be found in the /Developer folder while X11.app is in the /Applications/Utilities folder.)
 
2. Install qt3, qt3-designer, qt3-dev, qt3-doc, qt3-linguist and qt3-shlibs from fink.

3. cd to the qsynth-0.2.3 directory and create config.h.in and configure:
	make -f Makefile.cvs

4. Configure and make:
	./configure "CPPFLAGS=-I/sw/include/qt" --disable-system-tray; make
	
FAIR WARNING: Please, avoid enabling the "Output peak level meters" option,
which is known to raise a general "bus error" exception on startup, making
QSynth unusable. Please do report if you ever get the level meters to sneak
up on Mac OS X.

Enjoy.
