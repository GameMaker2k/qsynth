Description: A fluidsynth Qt GUI Interface
  Qsynth is a fluidsynth GUI front-end application written in C++
  around the Qt framework using Qt Designer. Eventually it may evolve
  into a softsynth management application allowing the user to control
  and manage a variety of command line softsynths but for the moment
  it wraps the excellent FluidSynth (http://www.fluidsynth.org).
  FluidSynth is a command line software synthesiser based on the
  Soundfont specification.
