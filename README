qsynth - A fluidsynth Qt GUI Interface
--------------------------------------

QSynth is a fluidsynth GUI front-end application written in C++ around the Qt3
toolkit using Qt Designer. Eventually it may evolve into a softsynth management
application allowing the user to control and manage a variety of command line
softsynths but for the moment it wraps the excellent FluidSynth (http://www.fluidsynth.org).
FluidSynth is a command line software synthesiser based on the Soundfont specification.

Installation
------------

The installation procedure follows the standard for source distributions.
Unpack the tarball and in the extracted source directory:

    ./configure [--prefix=/usr/local]
    make

and optionally as root:

    make install

This procedure will end installing the following couple of files:

    ${prefix}/bin/qsynth
    ${prefix}/share/icons/qsynth.xpm

Just launch ${prefix}/bin/qsynth and you're off (hopefully).

Note that the default installation path ${prefix} is /usr/local.


Configuration
-------------

QSynth holds its settings and configuration state per user, in a file
located as $HOME/.qt/qsynthrc. Normally, there's no need to edit this file,
as it is recreated and rewritten everytime qsynth is run.

Bugs
----

Plenty still although this is beta software ;)


Support
-------

QSynth is open source free software. For bug reports, feature requests,
discussion forums, mailling lists, or any other matter related to the
development of this piece of software, please use the Sourceforge
project page (http://sourceforge.net/projects/qsynth).


Acknowledgements
----------------

QSynth has been created by Rui Nuno Capela, Richard Bown and Chris Cannam
to bring a simple but effective software synthesier front end to the Linux
desktop.  From an original idea by Richard Bown and Chris Cannam to create
an open software synthesiser front end to use in conjunction with Rosegarden
(http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/rosegarden) and other ALSA based
software sequencers.

Inspired by Rui's work on QjackCtl (http://qjackctl.sourceforge.net).


Enjoy.
